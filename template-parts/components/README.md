# Component Naming Guidelines

This document outlines the standards for naming components in our PHP project. Adhering to these guidelines ensures consistency, readability, and maintainability across our codebase.

## Introduction

Consistent component naming is crucial for readability and maintainability. These guidelines are derived from common best practices and adapted for our project's needs.

## Base Component Names

### Definition
Base components are those that apply general layout and styling and are used frequently. They should be prefixed with `Base` to clearly distinguish them from other components.

### Examples
- `BaseButton.php`
- `BaseInput.php`
- `BaseCard.php`

## Single Instance Component Names

### Definition
Single instance components are used once per view or layout. These components should be prefixed with `The` to signify their uniqueness.

### Examples
- `TheHeader.php`
- `TheFooter.php`
- `TheSidebar.php`

## Multi-Word Component Names

### Definition
All component names should be multi-word to avoid conflicts with PHP classes and ensure clarity.

### Examples
- `UserProfile.php`
- `SearchBar.php`
- `ProductDetail.php`

## General Naming Conventions

1. **PascalCase for Component Names**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `MyComponent`) for naming components.
2. **Descriptive and Specific Names**: Ensure component names are descriptive and specific to their purpose and content.
