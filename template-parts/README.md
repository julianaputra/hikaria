# Template Parts Directory

This directory contains reusable template parts that can be included in multiple templates throughout the WordPress theme. Using template parts helps to maintain a clean and organized codebase by separating different sections of the layout into manageable parts.

## Introduction

The `template-parts` directory is a central place to store small, reusable pieces of template code. These template parts can include headers, footers, sidebars, and other sections of the website layout. By modularizing these parts, the theme becomes easier to manage and update.
