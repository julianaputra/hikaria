# Components Directory

This directory contains individual SCSS files for various UI components. Organizing your SCSS files into components helps maintain a clean and manageable codebase, making it easier to work with and scale your project.

## Introduction

The `components` directory is used to store SCSS files for reusable UI components. By separating components into their own files, we ensure that the styles are modular and easy to maintain.
